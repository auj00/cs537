1. block size = 512B

2. number of inodes in the file system         =  command line argument to mkfs.command
   number of data blocks in the file system    =  command line argument to mkfs.command (multiple of 32)

3. Inodes:  every inode always starts at the location divisible by 512
            "allocate" full 512B for each inode.

4. The disk is a file -> but you mmap the file -> so then you are working with memory

5. @1042 : root directory inode number = 0

6. @1042 : Disks are just files, so their name could (theoretically) be up to 255 characters.
           You don't need to ensure that the superblock is less than 512 bytes.
